# Test scenario:
#
# We need add the test case for it. For instance, three nodes with the same voting power, the init value is 0.6, then
# the claim finalized after two transactions. After update it as 0.8, then we need three transactions. And the update
# for network A doesn't impact other network. -- by @juniuszhou
